C Shell

TODO

-CD needs cleaning up, double setting dirMem for no reason. Shouldn't reset prev if it's equal to current dir? Just rewrite using setenv() and protected env variables (rewrite some of newEnvVar).

-Absolute path handling improvements (./ls should work inside /bin for example)

-Timeout feature

-Asssignment #3 stuff
